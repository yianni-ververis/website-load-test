### Website Load Tester

This is a command line tool that opens multiple tabs on Chromium and handles interactions, to load test the server and the Qlik Engine.

Currently we only have the fullpage.js scenario where the script open tabs, and immitates scrolling for navigation and trigger the engine api calls.

- enter the paramaters in the index.js and then run
- `npm run test fullpage`
